A month-long investigation into the idea of using pre-existing letters, words, and sentences to compose new messages.

Using a custom processing pipeline based on the open-source character-recognition software [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr), I replaced each word in a given work of literature with scanned images of matching words from another. The results are presented in the form of images, an interactive web application and printed books.
