Aside is a neighbourhood restaurant in south London. I built them I simple Wordpress website that shows a different photograph each time the site loads. The identity designed by [James Edgar](http://edgar-walker.com/) is based around [Larish Neue](https://radimpesko.com/fonts/larish-neue) by Radim Pesko.
