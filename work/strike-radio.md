> Strike Radio is an open platform to live broadcast and archive picket lines, strikes and protests. It acts as a temporary communication platform during events, strikes or durational political action, allowing those who are not physically in the same place to engage, tune in and feel part of a wider conversation. Those at the heart of the event can share their experience and broadcast to a wider periphery, enabling an of-the-minute update in the actions and movements of the protest or event.

The website is built as a custom Wordpress theme using [Timber](https://www.upstatement.com/timber/).
