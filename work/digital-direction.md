Microsite for the [MA Digital Direction](https://www.rca.ac.uk/schools/school-of-communication/digital-direction/) 2020 graduate show at the Royal College of Art, London. Design and code by me, art direction by [Xi Cheng](https://chenachenc.com/). Built in [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), with some light [three.js](https://threejs.org/) for the display typography. [Untitled Sans](https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/untitled-sans/) by Kris Sowersby / Klim Type Foundry is used throughout.
