Website for *Picnic Collective*, a new independent online residency programme founded by RCA graduates Julia Mahrer and Barney Kass. 

I built the main site with art direction from Julia and Barney, and designed and built a grid-based editor artists use to produce their own residency pages. Both are built in React and hosted on Netlify. We initially kept the data in a Google spreadsheet, but recently migrated to Sanity as the data became more complex.

[Acumin Pro Variable](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/acumin) by Adobe/Robert Slimbach is used throughout.
