*Picnic Collective* is an new independent residency programme founded by RCA graduates.

I designed and built the site with Julia Mahrer and Barney Kass, and developed a custom grid-based editor to let artists produce their own residency pages.

Both the main website and the editor are built in React with React-Router and hosted on Netlify. [Acumin Pro (Variable)](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/acumin) from Adobe is used throughout.
