## February 29

- The site has three sections:
    1. Events (upcoming and past) with images, documentation of past events, and a way to participate in upcoming ones.
    2. Recources. A list of useful stuff published elsewhere. Depending on the volume these are probably ordered into several categories, and maybe each one has a short introduction.
    3. About / Contact / Newsletter signup / How to contribute / Link to the sourcecode
- We decided to go with a pretty long URL: ```neurodiversity-in-albertopolis.co.uk```. But this is clearer than abbreviating some or all of the words, and the dashes help to differentiate the three words.
- The whole point of the website is to be accessible to neurodivergent people and everyone else.
- We're going to be [WCAG AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/) compliant.
- We decided that there should be some tools available to change how the website looks. This shouldn't be hidden in some menu like it usually is, but become a central part of the design. We're unsure what exactly should go into this toolbox, but some candidates are:
    - High Contrast Mode / Dark Mode
    - Change type size
    - Change typeface (Though not Dyslexie)
    - Change colours in general
    - Colour overlays - Roland promises some research that says these can be effective.
- We were looking at the *Recite* toolbar for reference, which is a piece of software that's added to a website after it's built and contains some of these tools. It has more, like a dictionary and a loupe, but we feel the more effective, and universal move is to commit to writing clear English.
- On the typeface choice: Roland has been using [GT Cinetype]() for the promotional material. I'm going to argue to move to IBM Plex Sans for a number of reasons:
    - Character differentiation. Plex includes some features usually only found in programming fonts, like an I with serifs which makes a word like "Illicit" much easier to read. It also has a slashed 0 as an alternate. This is an idea I became aware of through [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont)
    - Smooth outlines. Cinetype is a specific reference to a family of typefaces used in early cinema, and is composed entirely out of straight lines. That's cool but uncommon enough to trip you up while reading.
    - Bigger stroke contrast, helps the definition of individual letters
    - Range of weights, large character set.
    - Unambigious licensing situation - it's open source. 
- Date formats: I propose we write dates out in full: "January 20, 2021, 4pmâ€”5.30pm GMT". People are used to all kinds of shorthand notations, this one is unambigious for everyone.
