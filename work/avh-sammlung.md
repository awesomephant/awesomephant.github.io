I designed and built an online database of the biological study collecton at my _Gymnasium_ in Konstanz, Germany. At the time of this writing roughly a third of the collection is catalogued.

The site is built on Wordpress, allowing different members of the team to add photographs and information in a structured way.

[Suisse Int'l](https://www.swisstypefaces.com/fonts/suisse/) is used throughout. View the live site at [avh-sammlung.de](http://avh-sammlung.de/).
