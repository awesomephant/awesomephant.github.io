I designed and built a new website for Assembly Point, an art gallery in South London. We worked together to figure out the different types of content they produce and how it should be displayed - exhibitions, events, edition items and so on. I continue to work with the good people of AP to expand and improve the site. 

[Suisse Int'l](https://www.swisstypefaces.com/fonts/suisse/) is used throughout. View the live site at [avh-sammlung.de](http://avh-sammlung.de/).
