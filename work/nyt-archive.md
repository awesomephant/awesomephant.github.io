In an attempt to engage with archival material in a new way, I filtered archival editions of the New York Times (ranging from the early 19th century to the early 2000s) for headlies containing references to primary colours: Red, blue, and yellow. The clippings were ordered chronologically and collected into a book.

The result is a strange slice through American history. For instance, the word "Yellow" first appears in reference to yellow fever, before tunring into a racial slur in the 20th century. In the most recent editions of the Times, it is largely used to describe consumer goods.

Note that I'm in no way affiliated with the New York Times.
