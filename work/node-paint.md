An experimental web-based drawing tool controlled by a graphical programming interface.

This started [as an attempt to reverse-engineer](https://codepen.io/maxakohler/pen/ydqVjO) the branding for RCA Show 2019 by [Regular Practice](http://www.regularpractice.co.uk/). It's also part of a continued exploration of visual expressions of mathematics â€“ see [Gradient Drawings](https://www.maxkoehler.com/2019/typecast/) from earlier this year.

View the [live app here](https://www.maxkoehler.com/node-paint/) (best viewed on desktop). The code is [on Github](https://github.com/awesomephant/node-paint).

This is also my first React app. I made a conscious decision to write this in React because building a real-world thing tends to be the best way to learn new technology for me. It probably slowed me down (especially at the start, when I was still coming to grips with JSX and the top-down dataflow), but it's worth the effort.

I didn't read much outside the [official React documentation](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html), which has to be one of the best pieces of technical writing out there. I'm convinced the quality of the onboarding process is a major reason why React is as succesful as it is.
