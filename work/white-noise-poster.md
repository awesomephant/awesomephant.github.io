Letterpress-printed poster for the January 2020 edition of [White Noise](https://www.instagram.com/rcawhitenoise/), a monthly event showcasing sound experiments by students at the Royal College of Art. 

The lettering was printed from a lasercut MDF plate, the supporting type in metallic copper was printed from a Monotype-cast Univers Light held at the Royal College. The pixelation effect was achieved using ```pixelise-svg```, a [custom post-processing script](https://github.com/awesomephant/pixelise-svg) written in React.
