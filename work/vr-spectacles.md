My project in my final year on the Graphic Design FdA at Camberwell was to *"make VR shit"*. I designed and built a series of vignettes exploring different visuals and interactions in virtual reality.

All of this was built in [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) (with 3d-modelling in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)), so it works in the browser without having to install anything. I ran this on a Samsung Galaxy S6 in a Gear VR, and the performance was surprisingly good. 

The title is a reference to the [first piece of literature to describe virtual reality goggles](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/22893/22893-h/22893-h.htm).
