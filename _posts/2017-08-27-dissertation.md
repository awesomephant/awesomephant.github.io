intro: "The Bauhaus today is remembered mostly for its physical artifacts: Steel tube furniture, household appliances put together from geometric shapes, New Typography, all set against the backdrop of flat-roofed, pristine white architecture. The philosophical and political struggle that led to these outcomes seems distant to us. Reading some of the manifestos published at the Bauhaus, written in somewhat stilted 1920s German can only give us a faint idea of the monumental endeavour the Bauhausler were engaged in."

Having found themselves in a country still recovering from the first world war, with new technology changing every aspect of life, they took it upon them to design the new world, one teapot at a time. What emerged was a vision for society in which citizens, architecture, product design, agriculture, entertainment, science and art would exist together in one unified, "rational" programme: Modernism. To the young people at the Bauhaus, overlooking Dessau from their glass-wrapped studios this idea must have felt utterly within reach: In a country struggling to recover from the first World War, with violent revolutions going on in Europe and new technology changing every aspect of life, change seemed inevitable. (Moller, 2015)

How exactly that change should look like, the Bauhausler never quite agreed on. The early Bauhaus was driven by the search for individual expression. Johannes Itten, with his head shaved and wearing a robe of his own design taught the now-famous Vorkurs: Here, students developed their personal means of expression through meditation, philosophy and basic exercises. The Sommerfeld House in Berlin with its excentric, hand-crafted decoration is an often-cited example for the expresionism of the early Bauhaus (Bauhaus100.de, 2017).

The Bauhaus started to move toward a more collective outlook in 1922, when Theo van Doesburg, a proponent of De Stijl began teaching at the Bauhaus. He introduced the reduction to geometric shapes and primary colours that would come to define the "Bauhaus Style". The following year Hungarian artist Laszlo Moholy-Nagy took over teaching of the preliminary course. He replaced much of Itten's individualistic curriculum with exercises using industrial material. In the following years, objectivity and scientific rigor remained the governing thought at the Bauhaus. It was during this later period that Marcel Breuer produced furniture out of precision steel tube (then a cutting-edge material), Marianne Brandt designed household items for mass-production and Gropius himself completed some of the most iconic examples of modernist architecture (Droste, 1998).

Despite its academic success the Bauhaus was faced with political pressure from its inception. The increasingly right-wing government of Weimar forced the Bauhaus to move to Dessau. However, the rise of the Nazis on a national level brought the end of the Bauhaus. After a brief period in Berlin under the leadership of Mies van der Rohe, the remaining Bauhausler agreed to disband in 1933. Many were forced to flee Germany, which of course only served to spread Bauhaus ideas. Gropius, Breuer, Mies and others continued to teach in the United States, contributing to the emergence of the "International Style". (Wilder, 2016)

The architectural legacy of this period surrounds us to this day. I'm writing this from a 1960s university building with steel windows, concrete slab floors and curtain walls not dissimilar to what Gropius used 40 years prior in Dessau. Similar buildings can be found in cities all over the world. 

When we ask about the conflict between individualism and collectivism in modernism, we should start by defining the conflict. Over the course of this essay, I'm in effect going to examine two different conflicts.

First, there is the conflict between the collectivist, egalitarian vision of modernism and the image of the heroic, sole creator (be it Le Corbusier, Walter Gropius or Mies van der Rohe) who is tasked to bring that vision to life. This is linked to Marianne Dekoben's analysis of modernism and gender, which places the myth of the (male) hero artist at the very centre of modernist thinking. 

Secondly, I'm going to examine the conflict between modernist architecture and the individualism of the people inhabiting it in the context of post-war consumerism. This conflict is defined on one side by the utopian vision of the Bauhausler: A world in which housing, transportation, appliances, culture and food is designed through a scientific process and mass-produced by machines to be affordable to everyone. By reducing forms to their functional minimum, the Bauhaus aimed to create universal solutions for housing, education and everyday life.

On the other side is the populist critique of modern housing as being fundamentally at odds with the people's inherent individualism, as evidenced by the ubiquitous image of the derelict block - A line of attack which originates in the 1970s. Oscar Newman's 1972 study "Defensible Space: People and Design in the Violent City" linked modernist housing with increased crime, arguing that the spatial design of housing blocks makes them inherently unsafe, and that private space, rather than public space should be prioritized. Newman's study has since been criticised as relying on overly broad assumptions about the nature of human interaction, for instance by Steventon (1996). Popular critics such as Tom Wolfe (1981) criticise modernist housing as being overly academic and fundamentally unfit for its purpose. Wolfe cites the widely publicized demolition of the Pruitt–Igoe housing estate in St. Louis in 1972 (only 20 years after its construction) as evidence for the failure of modernist principles.

To see how these two conflicts manifest themselves in physcial architecture I'm going to introduce the architectural practice at the Bauhaus, placing it in the wider context of modernist thinking. I will then examine the Dessau-Torten housing settlement near Leipzig, Germany as an example of this practice. Built by Walter Gropius between 1927 and 1930, Torten has been subject to significant alterations by its residents over the last 90 years. By tracking these alterations, I will show how these underlying conflicts shift and overlap over time. In closing, I will examine more recent housing models in the context of a post-industrial economy, again discussing how the conflict between individualism and collectivist ideas is reconciled.


## The Myth of the Hero Creator

The emergence of modernism in the beginning of the 20th century coincides with the first wave of feminism. The modernist focus on the machine, speed, efficiency and opposition of ornament and sentimentality is seen by critics as a reactionary response by male modernists to the new, empowered woman (Dekoven, 1999). We see this reflected in the openly misogynist language of the 1909 futurist manifesto:

> We will glorify war—the world's only hygiene—militarism, patriotism, the destructive gesture of freedom-bringers, beautiful ideas worth dying for, and scorn for woman.
> We will destroy the museums, libraries, academies of every kind, will fight moralism, feminism, every opportunistic or utilitarian cowardice.
(Marinetti, 1909)

Here Marinetti is laying out the idea of the heroic, hyper-male modernist creator - an idea that is ultimately reflected in the Futurist movement's support for fascism (Blum, 2014).

In contrast to this regressive notion of the authoritarian male artist stand in contrast to the egalitarian aims of modernist movements, which included the empowerment of women as DeKoven points out:

> [...] Male Modernist fear of women’s new power [...] resulted in the combination of misogyny and triumphal masculinism that many critics see as central, defining features of Modernist work by men. This masculinist misogyny, however, was almost universally accompanied by its dialectical twin: a fascination and strong identification with the empowered feminine. (DeKoven, 1999, p228)

DeKoven is talking about this contradiction in the context of modernist literature here, but I would argue that her analysis can be expanded to architecture: The figure of the sharply dressed hero architect (be it Le Corbusier, Walter Gropius or Mies van der Rohe) stands in contrast to the egalitarian, collectivist vision of society they were working towards.

## From Marinetti to Gropius

It is possible to draw a direct lineage from the Futurist movement to the Bauhaus. In 1910, Adolf Loos repeats Marinetti's denunciation of ornament (though with a Darwinian twist, arguing that "*cultural evolution* is equivalent to the removal of ornament"). Loos goes on to say that

> [...] Ornament is not only produced by criminals; it itself commits a crime, by damaging men's health, the national economy and cultural development. [...] Even greater is the damage ornament inflicts on the workers. As ornament is no longer a natural product of our civilization, it accordingly represents backwardness or degeneration [...]  (Loos, 1910)

The notion that ornament is to be overcome in order to achieve progress is reflected in Gropius' 1919 Bauhaus manifesto:

> The ornamentation of the building was once the main purpose of the visual arts, and they were considered indispensable parts of the great building. Today, they exist in complacent isolation, from which they can only be salvaged by the purposeful and cooperative endeavours of all artisans.

"The ultimate goal of all art" at the Bauhaus, as Gropius goes on to declare, is architecture. He then explains how "the new building" would unite all artistic disciplines - again an echoing the Futurists' denunciation of the past:

> So let us therefore create a new guild of craftsmen, free of the divisive class pretensions that endeavoured to raise a prideful barrier between craftsmen and artists! Let us strive for, conceive and create the new building of the future that will unite every discipline, architecture and sculpture and painting, and which will one day rise heavenwards from the million hands of craftsmen as a clear symbol of a new belief to come.' (Gropius, 1919)

It is worth noting how Gropius is invoking medieaval imagery to talk about the future. The concept of craft guilds, which Gropius refers to in the opening sentence dates back to the 13th century. Further, the "building [...] that will unite every discipline [...] and which will rise heavenwards" is a clear reference to the medieaval cathedral, which is confirmed by Lionel Feininger's "Cathedral" Woodcut used to illustrate the text (Burshart, 2009).

Although these mediaval aesthetics seem opposed to the Marinetti's vision of a mechanised future, the underlying ideas are consistent. There is the denunciation of the past, the rejection of (female) ornamentation in favour of (male) clarity  and objectivity. With his biblical language, Gropius positions himself as the hero artist who will facilitate the renewal of society. The contradiction described by DeKoven is perhaps epitomised in Gropius' admission policy: While women were allowed at the Bauhaus (a progressive move in 1919), Gropius made sure they were funneled into the weaving and painting workshops. The architecture department was exclusively male (Droste, 1999).

## Architecture at the Bauhaus

Following the medieavalist imagery of the manifesto, work at the early Bauhaus was defined by a return to pre-industrial forms. The Sommerfeld House in Berlin (1920, destroyed 1945) with its expressionist wooden decoration, as well as the early furniture of Marcel Breuer and Gunta Stölzl and some of the early pottery are examples of this phase (Bauhaus100, 2017). Christina Lodder places the early Bauhaus as of a larger movement in search of "spiritual utopia". She argues that "a rejection of materialism and 19th-century positivist outlooks impelled painters associated with Expressionism to infuse the work of art with a spiritual dimension, and to promote the idea that art and architecture were thereby the means of saving mankind from modernity" (Lodder, 2006 Page 24). 

The transition to a more rational, technology-focussed outlook at the Bauhaus came after the end of the first world war with the arrivals of Theo van Doesburg and Lazlo Moholy-Nagy in Weimar. This new direction was defined by the notion that scientific progress, industrial production and rational decision-making could be employed to solve the "materialism, repressive political structures and glaring social inequalities" of the present (Lodder, Page 33). From the prespective of modernists crime, disease, alcoholism and scoial inequality were directly linked to the "overcrowded cities", "old and rotten buildings and poor sanitary conditions" (Le Corbusier, 1923) that industralisation had left behind. 

A 1930 film titled "Das Neue Wohnen" [The new Living] illustrates this idea in striking images (Figure 0.1). Dark shots of derelict workers' homes are interspersed with scenes of domestic violence and disease. This is then set in contrast to the mdoernist vision of the future: Brightly lit shots of clean interiors with mass-produced, ornament-free furniture. The film ends with a title card announcing: "A better future will hold affordable and humane housing FOR EVERYONE" - emphasizing the aspiration for social equality that imbues modernist thinking.

![Das Neue Wohnen](/assets/unit-9/die-neue-wohnung-web.jpg)
**Figure 0.1**: Video stills from "Das Neue Wohnen" (1930)

The change in lighting from dark to bright in The New Living is no accident: Belief the benefits of heliotherapy (the idea that sunlight and air could cure diseases) was widespread in the 1920s, as was the notion that personal hygiene and cleansiness would lead to a better society (Wilk, 2006). We see these ideas represented throughout modernist architecture, including Gropius. 

Gropius lays out his own version of these ideas in his 1925 book "Ein Versuchshaus des Bauhauses in Weimar" [A trial building by the Bauhaus in Weimar]. The title refers to the Haus am Horn in Weimar, which was built for the Bauhaus exhibition in 1923. In the introduction Gropius argues that the new age "makes it necessary to finally realise the old idea of building typical dwellinggs cheaper, better and in larger numbers to give every family access to healthy living conditions" (page 5). The way to achieve this, according to Gropius is to understand the housing problem "in its entire sociological, economical, technical and formal context". (page 5). Gropius also has some specific ideas on how these issues might be addressed. 

He argues that because most people have similar basic needs, housing should be uniform and mass-produced in specialised factories. Rather than building houses individually at the building site, they should be dry-assembled from pre-manufactured components using standardised blueprints. Gropius coins the term "large-scale building blocks" ["Baukasten im Grossen"] to describe this form of modular architecture. Figure 0.1 illustrates this idea: Individual components (labelled 1 though 6) are assembled into different "machines for living" according to the "number and needs of the inhabitants".

![Large Scale Building Blocks](/assets/unit-9/baukasten-im-grossen.jpg)
**Figure 0.1:** Illustration showing the concept of Gropius' "Large-Scale Building Blocks", published in Bauhausbuch 3: Ein Versuchshaus des Bauhauses in Weimar, 1925. Unknown artsit, Walter Gropius.

The artistic challenge, according to Gropius, lies in finding satisfying spatial arrangements of these building blocks. Gropius briefly mentions the idea that contrary to popular belief, smaller rooms might actually lead to better living conditions (Gropius, 1930). What he is referring to here is the idea of the "minimum dwelling"

This was reinforced from 1928, when Swiss architect Hannes Meyer took over the post of director from Walter Gropius. While Gropius argued that the artist should be part of the building process along with other experts, Meyer demands rigorous functionalism. In a 1926 article he declares: 

> Building is a biological process. Building is not an aesthetic process. Reduced to its elements, the new dwelling will be not just a machine for living, but a biological device to fulfill psychological and physical needs (Meyer 1926, Page 4)

In the same publication he lists the "schedules of people inside and outside the house, physical aspects of the building site, sunlight, acoustics and psychology" as datapoints that sohuld be used to inform architectural decisions. His architectural drawings are filled with tables and graphs describing the results of soil analysis, sunlight calculations and weather observations at the building site. Under the brief tenure of Mies van der Rohe from 1930 to 1933 the understanding of architecture at the Bauhaus shifted away from the strict functionalism of Hannes Meyer toward a more aesthetically-driven exploration of space.

## The Dessau-Torten Settlement

Over 50 building projects were completed by members of the Bauhaus between 1919 and 1930, and countless more after the school disbanded (Engels, 2001). This count includes buildings that were built by Gropius and others relatively independently from the Bauhaus, but some were the result of the type of cross-discipline collaboration that was at the core of the Bauhaus idea. These large-scale projects addressed real-world issues while at the same time serving as cross-discipline classroom experiments at the Bauhaus.

A few of these buildings have become instantly recognisable: The Sommerfeld House (referenced above), the Haus am Horn (1923) and The Bauhaus Building and Master's houses in Dessau (1925-26). However, it is the lesser-known examples of Bauhaus architecture that might give us the most insight into the conflicts laid out above. The example I will be discussing here is the Dessau-Torten housing settlement in Dessau, Germany. Unlike other examples of pre-war modernist architecture, Dessau-Torten was subject to significant changes since its construction between 1926 and 1928 (Bauhaus Dessau, 2017). In a form of modern archeology, we can identify different layers of changes made before, during and after the second world war, right up to present day. Each layer can give us hints as to how the conflict between modernist ideas and different forms of individualism were reconciled.

## Initial Construction

After a planned housing project in Weimar had failed to materialise (only one building, the Haus am Horn, was ever completed), Torten was the first opportunity for Gropius to put the ideas he had developed during the early 1920s to practice on a large scale. In fact the prospect of building Torten, supported by the social-democratic government of Dessau, was part of the reason Gropius moved the Bauhaus to Dessau in the first place. Dessau, a rising industrial town, had seen an an influx of workers that nearly doubled its population. This led to a housing crisis which the Bauhaus was hoped to address.

Torten was financed in part by the national government as part of a larger effort to provide affordable housing to lower-income families. Individual units in Torten were sold for between RM 9.500 and RM 10.100, or around RM 35 per month - well within the reach of an average industrial worker (Schwarting, 2011). The fact that units were sold off to individuals is critical: It gave home-owners the freedom to make changes to their houses with few restrictions.

![Dessau Waterfall](/assets/unit-9/torten-waterfall.jpg)
**Figure 1.5:** Waterfall chart showing the order of contstruction phases in Dessau Torten

The settlement served a double, or even triple purpose from the beginning. The Dessau government was hoping for a pragmatic solution to their housing shortage. The national government saw Torten in part as a research project to test new construction methods, granting Gropius additional funds in 1928 to carry out construction experiments and publish the results. Finally, Gropius saw Torten as a way of proving the validity of his vision of architecture, which he had written about for years.

This triple purpose reflects the conflict at the centre of this essay. One one side is the city of Dessau in an effort to provide workers' housing, on the other side is Gropius, the hero architect eager to prove his ideas. We can see Gropius' eagerness in the amount of documents, photographs and films documenting the construction process of Torten. Figure 1.5 shows what today might be referred to as a waterfall chart. Each bar indicates a specific step in the construction to be carried out at a particular time. This illustrates how Gropius not only designed the architecture, but also the production process and the documentation to fit his vision. He writes about the production process in 1930:

> The execution of the shells was done based on a carefully designed plan, in such a way that fixings, wall components and ceiling beams could be manufactured at the building site in a conveyor belt-like process. This limited loss time and material by design (Gropius, 1930)

The visual language of Torten also seems to be inspired by the conveyor belt. 
In addition to employing familiar clues of modernist architecture (flat roofs, exposed construction through different surface treatments, factory-like steel fixings) Gropius uses mirrored floor plans. By positioning doors and windows of each unit at oppsing edges of the facade, Gropius is able to effectively blur the line between units. Rather than a row of identical houses, this creates the effect of a continuous band - Le Corbusier's "Machine for Living" stretched out like a conveyor belt.

Gropius transforms a pre-existing electrical tower into a theatrical monument to progress by placing it at the intersection of the two main roads, making it visible from almost every point of the settlement.

![Dessau Torten Gardens](/assets/unit-9/torten-1920-2.jpg)
**Figure 3:** Contemporary photograph showing the garden side of row houses in Dessau Torten.

Contrary to the modernist visual language, the urban planning of the settlement follows the much earlier concept of the garden city. The notion of the garden city was first proposed by Ebeneezer Howard in 1889, the garden city is based on the idea of individual self-sufficiency for each family. In Torten this takes the form of a 400 square metre garden attached to each dwelling (Fig. 3). In addition, Gropius opted for specialised dry toilets (even though Torten was attached to the sewer network) to generate garden fertilizer. This runs contrary to the idea of the minimum dwelling that Gropius alludes to in many of his writings. Rather than "rationalising" food production in "kitchen factories that could feed 10.000" (Teige, 2012 p?), the garden city

![Dessau Torten Construction](/assets/unit-9/torten-construction-1.jpg)
**Figure 2:** Contemporary photograph showing a row of houses in Dessau Torten under construction.

Figure 2 shows a section of houses in Dessau Torten under construction. It highlights the rationalised construction Gropius designed: Rather than building each house individually, a whole section of identical houses was built at once. This photograph is part of an extensive series of professionally-executed photographs documenting the construction process. The fact that such extensive documentation was done can be attributed in part to the experimental nature of Torten - Gropius' experiments had to be documented to be scientifically valid. However, this photograph is more than a neutral document: The two small figures in the background and the dramatic lighting conditions give a monumental scale to the scene. The row of houses continues beyond the right edge of the photograph, reinforcing the feeling of scale. All of this invokes the feeling of optimism and larger-than-life ambition that imbues Gropius' architecture. 

This image is featured along others in Gropius' 1930 book "Bauhausbauten Dessau", which suggests that Gropius was not only aware of the image, but approved of its message. In addition, a Berlin production company was comissioned to create a documentary showing the construction of the settlement, further underlining Gropius' view of Torten as a vehicle to communicate his ideas. 

## Alterations before the Second World War

We see the first major deviation from Gropius' plan the day the first families moved in. Few families could afford the RM 1350 for Marcel Breuer's specially designed furniture set, so they brought in an ecclectic collection of traditional furniture, wallpapers and curtains, which made an awkward fit in Gropius' small floor plans.

Following the initial construction, heat insulation quickly became a concern. Anectotal accounts describe how doors and windows would freeze shut during the first winter. This was a direct result of shortcomings in the design.

1. The steel frame, single glass windows chosen by Gropius were cutting-edge technology at the time. As such, they were not only a third more expensive than traditional wooden windows but also caused major heat loss due to their size and lack of insulation. Most of these windows were replaced smaller, wooden windows within 10 years of the initial construction.
2. The thin outer walls formed another route for heat to escape. This was a direct result of their industrialised production - since their concrete slabs all had the same dimensions, heat bridges could form between the gaps. Home-owners addressed this by errecting secondary brick facades shortly after the initial construction.

I would argue that this set of changes can be read as the home-owners' collective response to Gropius' heroic ambitions. Gropius, an established architect, would likely have been aware of the heat insulation issues caused by his choice of construction method and window fittings. The reason he proceeded anyway might be attributed to the role of Torten as a proof of concept for Gropius' ideas. Yes, steel windows might be more expensive now, we could imagine him reasoning, but they will be much cheaper once industrial production has caught up. Gropius says as much in 1930, admitting that it would take the construction industry some time to adjust to the new way of building (Gropius, 1930).

We can frame this conflict in terms of time: Gropius is looking toward the future, willing to give up practical considerations in order to design a clean break with the past. On the other side are the people of Torten, who are concerned with the present. The individualised ownership of Torten gives them the upper hand in this conflict. 

When the Nazis came to power in the 1930s, they mounted a concerted effort to replace all of Gropius' steel windows that still remained. This removed the visual effect of Gropius' "conveyor belt" by re-emphasising the lines between neighbouring houses. The addition of fences, hedges and flower beds between dwellings added to this.

This came after earlier plans to rebuild Torten from the ground had proven financially unviable and was fashioned into a propaganda victory by the right-wing press at the time. About half an hour up the road, the Bauhaus building itself was surrounded by a grouping of pitched-roof, traditionally-built apartment buildings during this period.

While a full survey of fascist aesthetics is beyond the scope of this essay, we can place this coordinated effort to alter existing architecture in the broader context Nazi propaganda. As Koepnick (1999) points out,

> [...] the Nazis followed two different but overlapping strategies. In their pursuit of a homogenous community of the folk, the Nazis made numerous concessions to the popular demand for the warmth of private life and pleasure in a modern media society [...] but simultaneously hoped that the [...] spectacle of modern consumer culture would break the bonds of old solidarities and prepare the atomized individual for the auratic shapes of mass politics, for mass rituals that promised a utopian unification of modern culture

This would explain why the Nazi government went to such lengths to remove any visual references to collectivist ideas (i.e. Gropius' "conveyor belt") from Torten. By temporarily encouraging the individualism of modern consumer culture, the government hoped to align people with their totalitarian agenda.

Relating this back to our orginal question, I would argue that this point in time marks an overlap between the two definitions of individualism described above. The first definition, based in the image of the violent, energetic male of the Futurist movement is continued in the cult of personality of the fascist state. The second definition, based in modern consumerism is deployed here as a propaganda tool to ultimately achieve a "utopian unification of [...] culture". 

## Alterations after the Second World War

Immediately after the war, a number of buildings in Torten had to be rebuilt - Dessau, being the site of a Junkers factory had become a bombing target. Since little building material was available, many original components were re-used.

As the economic situation stabilises, the conflict between the collectivist ideals of modernism and individualism as defined to post-war comsumerism becomes more prevalent - even though Torten exists within the GDR. As the economic situation stabilises in the 1950s, people's focus turnes toward expanding their living space. Houses were expanded into the garden, and in many cases the roof terrace in the back was enclosed to create an additional room. Most of the original dry toilets were replaced with regular flush toilets. Schwarting makes the observation that the reason these expansions could be done relatively easily was the construction of the buildings, in which only the side walls were load-bearing. The argument can be made that Gropius did in fact choose this construction method with later expansions in mind. This would be in line with his thinking regarding modular housing which can be expanded and downsized with the changing size of the family. 

Contemporary photographs also suggest that the orignal above-ground electricity lines were moved underground during this period, removing another element of industrial aesthetic from the view of the observer. 

![Torten Antennas](/assets/unit-9/torten-antennas-edit.jpg)
**Figure 3:** 1965 photograph showing a row of houses in Torten equipped with long antennas to receive West-German television**

One of the more memorable images from this time (fig. 3) shows a row of houses, each with a tall anteanna used to illegally receive West-German television. This is in a way a reversal of the earlier power structure: Rather than implementing a set of political ideals from the top down through architecture (as Gropius had done), individuals are making an architectural change to subvert restrictions imposed by a socialist state. According to Husemann (2016), this was a fairly widespread act of disobedience against the government, with up to 85% of the GDR population receiving West-German television.

In terms of the conflict between collectivism and individualism, I read this as a victory of the latter: Individual residents, empowered by increasing wealth and education are satisfying their growing desire for media consumption in an act of direct action against an authoritarian state. 

During this period the use of the gardens also changes substantially. As the need for individual food production becomes less pronounced, the gardens take up a more recreational role. The space is also used to accomodate the increasing number of private cars in the settlement. Car ownership in the GDR increased drastically from 0.2 cars per 100 housholds in 1955 to 40 in 1982 (Edwards, 1985). In response to this, many home-owners build garages and carports along the back edge of their property, transforming the gravel path between opposing gardens into a secondary road. Like earlier alterations, these additions appear to be largely done on an individual basis according to stylistic preference and financial means.

Again, the spread of cars as a means of individualised transport and personal expression can be read as a victory of modern consumerism.

## Alterations after 1989

Another significant set of changes to Torten come after the collapse of the GDR, which gave residents access to an abundance of tools and building materials through DIY-retail, which had grown to a substantial industry since the 1960s. 

Figures 5.1 through 5.4 show the variety of doors, windows, house numbers, landscaping, facade materials and seasonal decorations that define the Torten settlement today. Figure 5.1 shows the only dwelling that remains almost entirely in the original 1928 condition - Compared with Figures 5.2 through 5.4, it illustrates the degree of visual diversification that has taken place over the last 90 years.

**Figure 5:** Signage in Dessau-Torten pointing out various points of interest.

With the increasing public recognition of the Bauhaus and its architectural output in the 1980s, public education has become a permanent part of the Torten settlement. In 1992 the first house was restored to its original state by a private foundation. Since then, a number of houses have been restored to various degrees by either the local government or their respective owners. (The notion of "original state" here is debatable - Many components that were mass-produced in the 1920s have to be custom-manufactured now. Further, signage pointing out various features (Fig. 5) as well as regular groups of architectural tourists enter the urban structure of the estate. Hannes Meyer's Konsum building now houses a permanent exhibition documenting the history of the estate.  

## Is Dessau Torten a succesful experiment?

It's easy to point out flaws with Gropius' plan for Torten. In his writings he argues for an architecture that is focussed on the needs of the people,  yet in Torten he seems happy to compromise on those needs in order to try out new materials and construction methods - the amount of alterations that had to be done shortly after the initial construction speaks to this. Further, we might come to the conclusion that Gropius' aesthetic programme failed as well: The second their economic situation allowed it, people covered up the white facades, swapped out the steel windows and decorated their front lawns. Rather than living in the homogenous machine for living Gropius had imagined, home-owners did everything in their power to differentiate themselves visually from their neighbours.

However the opposite case can also be made. Yes, people drastically changed the original floorplan to satisfy their needs. But the reason this could be done relatively easily and cheaply goes back to Gropius' modern construction, in which only the side walls are load-bearing. We can further argue that recent alterations, enabled by DIY-retail, are in fact a continuation of Gropius' concept of large-scale building blocks. Today components such as windows, doors, house numbers, garden plants and seasonal decorations are mass-produced, and designed to be assembled with little specialist knowledge or equipment - much like Gropius was imagining. 

## Collectivist housing models today

Modernist social housing was in many ways a response to the emergence of a new social class: the industrial worker. After the first world war rising industrial towns like Dessau attracted an influx of workers, leading to a sudden population increase the existing housing and infrastructure wasn't fit to handle. This led to the poor living conditions modernist architects recognised and attempted to improve through large-scale urban developments. As Daniel Bell (1999) shows, we now find ourselves in a similar societal transition - from an industrial society to a post-industrial one. According to Bell, this transition is marked by a number of factors: Agriculture and manufacturing are replaced by sercives as the primary source of employment ("services" meaning transportation and logistics, as well as education and healthcare). Further, the importance of physical infrastructure (roads, trains) decreases as "intellectual infrastructure" (internet connections, computing power) becomes the primary way to generate capital. As the industrial revolution created the industrial worker, the transition to a post-industrial society is likely to create new classes of people with new housing needs. 

We can see this process happening in front of us already. Deane Simpson (2015) describes a new class of people created entirely by scientific progress and the abundance of services in the post-industrial age: the "Young-Old". First described by Berncie Neugarten in 1974, the Young-Old are people at retirement age with higher purchasing power, higher likelihood living independently from their families, more education and better health status than those previously in their age group. According sociologist Andrew Blaikic, the Young-old might be the first large demographic group in history "whose daily experience [does] no consist of work or schooling [...]" (Simpson, p13)

According to Simpson, the emergence of the Young-Old can be linked to two factors aligned with Bell's analysis of the post-industrial society. First, advances in public health, nutrition and the decline of manual labour has led to an increased life expectancy in both industrial and developing countries - doubling from 40 years in 1840 to 80 years in 2000. Medical products developed over the last century, such as the artificial hip, the contact lens, electronic hearing aids and Viagra extend the physical capabilities of the body. This is in line with Bell's notion of a shift towards human services as the primary economic sector. Secondly, the decline of the multi-generational family creates a class of retirees that has to be more self-reliant than previous generations. Again this can be linked to Bell's description of post-industrialism: "Intellectual Work" can be done independently from any physical location. This in turn creates what Simpson describes as the "[increased] mobility requirements of the modern workforce, which drives people apart geographically" (Simpson, 2015, p 45).

Where in the 19th century the invention of the steam engine and fordist production methods brought about the industrial worker, it is scientific progress and the shift from industrial to intellectual work that brings about the Young-Old. They have the desire, health and financial means to live independently, thus making the institutional homes of previous generations unfit. At the same time, shifts in the labour market and changes in traditional values have made the traditional model of the multi-generational household unavailable (or undersireable). The only response to this new class of people seems to be the development of new housing models.

Simpson describes a number of these new housing models, including the "The Villages", a vast themed retirement community outside Orlando, Florida. With a population of 157.000 in 2016 (Rocco, 2015), The Villages are not only the largest retirement commmunity in the world, but America's fastest growing city overall. In many ways, they bear a striking resemblance to the social housing developments of the 1920s: Houses are mass-produced and laid out following a pre-conceived plan. Transportation, architecture, health care, local history, media and (by virtue of age- and income segregation) the social fabric of the settlement are part of a "Gesamtkunstwerk" of a scope far beyond what Gropius was able to do. Following this analogy, the hero architect of modernism is replaced by the faceless, owner-less post-industrial corporation.

In The Villages, the developers deploy a complex architectural system to create a certain "lifestyle experience". The settlement is split up into smaller "towns", each with its own, entirely fabricated local history. The developers use techniques developed in theme parks to artificially age buildings, and even go so far as to install fictional historical artifacts and historical plaques to create a feeling of local history. All of this is done (apparently succesfully) to encourage the kind of social interaction between residents that represent an idealised idea of life in a small town. The designers are surprisingly candid about this:

> [...] We write story lines that we use, and that comes from my theme park background. The story line acts as your concept, you go back to it to  design facades. It's funny, we make up stories for some of these buildings and some of the residents think they're real. They don't even know any better because we even go to the trouble of paining old graphics on the buildings and people think that's an old general store when it really isn't. (Simpson, 2015 page 207)

The primary means of transportation in the villages is the golf cart. This is another specific design decision by the developer: The golf cart bridges the gap between the automobile (which is costly, associated with the working life and requires a licence, which residents may have lost or never acquired in the first place if they relied on their spouse to drive) and the mobility scooter (which is slow and associated with frailty and failing health). The developer encourages golf cart use by making specific golf cart roads, bridges and tunnels part of the urban planning, and incorporating golf cart-related events (such as parades) into the social programme. This is reiterated by The Village's marketing material which often refers to points of interest being "only a short golf cart ride away".

We find the notion of using architectural intervention to design social interaction on a much smaller scale in Hannes Meyer’s work: His ADGB Trade Union School near Berlin (1928-1930) is designed to break students into groups of four - this was thought to be the ideal number to accomodate learning.

In marketing material for the villages we even find echoes of the 1920s notion of heliotherapy, for instance these song lyrics from a 2011 video advert showing landscape shots and residents interacting in bright sunlight:

> It's a little slice of paradise / Sunshine and golf galore / Neighbours stroll the old town square / And the good life is in store / The Villages / Where the sun shines all year round / The Villages / Florida's friendliest hometown / From our family to yours / From our family to yours / Come on / Come on down / We're Florida's friendliest hometown

(The Villages Florida, 2011).

How do the villages reconcile the confilct between their essentially collectivist design with their residents' desire fo individualism? I would argue that the developer achieves this by what is essentially marketing. They emphasise the benefits of the collectivist settlement (centralised access to healthcare, unified transportation, social cohesion) while creating the perception of individual freedom and self-governance - sometimes in the same TV commercial. I would argue that part of the reason this succeeds is the overwhelming scale of The Villages: With 2.400 organised clubs (one for every 65 residents), hundreds of sport facilities and thousands of planned events *a month* (125 on the day of this writing) the developers are able to create an environment in which individual choice seems unlimited. This perception of individual freedom is reinforced through carefully planned pockets of individual expression, such as residents decorating their golf carts (Perhaps analogous to the landscaping and seasonal decorations of Torten). In cases like this, the developer gives up direct design control - though the results are fed back (in the form of developer-sponsored parades and features in developer-funded local media) into the larger "lifestyle experience" the developer creates. 

## Conclusion
We've established that "the conflict between individualism and the collectivist ideals of modernism" is twofold, depending on how we frame the issue. Following the feminist critique of modernism, we've seen how the figure of the male hero architect stands in conflict with the egalitarian aims of the modernist movement.  We've seen this conflict played out in Walter Gropius' Dessau-Torten housing settlement, where he makes design decisions to establish his vision of the future, rather than addressing the pragmatic needs of the present.

After the second world war, the conflict between individualism and collectivism shifts from inside the modernist movement to the outside world and the individualism created by modern consumerism. The architectural interventions in Torten are evidence of a decade-long negotiation between the collectivist vision of modernism and people's post-fordist desire for self-expression.

The transition to a post-industrial society has created a demand for new forms of housing. The Villages of Florida are a vivid example of this. With their heavily programmed lifestyle, centralised medical care, transportation and mass-produced housing, they might be described as the urban manifestation of a kind of "leisure socialism" (Simpson, 2015, p 246). Here the figure of the hero architect of the 1920s is replaced by the owner-less corporation of the 1980s.

I will end by arguing that the contineud transition to a post-industrial economy will create continued demand for new forms of housing. A re-examination of modernist ideas of social housing might be part of this debate, in line with a broader re-examination of socialist ideas following a disillusionment with the results of economic liberalism. Shrimpton et. al (2017) sums up this growing sense of anxiety, showing that

> [...] Britons no longer think young people will have a better life than previous generations, with only around one quarter (23 per cent) of adults taking this view. Instead, roughly half (48 per cent) believe that millennials will have a worse life than their parents.

Indeed, emerging writers like Owen Hatherley ("Militant Modernism", 2009) and researchers like Peter Chadwick ("This Brutal World", 2016) are already shaping the conversation around the perception of modernist housing. Though I would take the position that in addition to a re-examination of modernist housing models, entirely new modes of living might be needed. In an economy that relies increasingly on intellectual labour done by an increasingly mobile workforce, perhaps this offhand remark by Gropius might gain new importance:

> Perhaps "mobile living-shells" ["mobile Wohngehause"], allowing us to take with us all the conveniences of a real [traditional] living standard even through relocations, are no longer too far-fetched a utopia. (Gropius, 1925 p5 )
