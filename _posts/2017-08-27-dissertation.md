## How does the conflict between social utopia and individualism in modernism manifest itself in everyday architecture?

## Introduction

The Bauhaus today is remembered mostly for its physical remnants: Steel tube furniture, household appliances put together from geometric shapes, asymmetrical typography, all set against the backdrop of flat-roofed, pristine white architecture. The Bauhaus manifestos, set all lowercase and calling for a cultural revolution in slightly stilted 1920s German mean little to us.

To the Bauhausler, they meant everything. Having found themselves in a country still recovering from the first world war, with new technology changing every aspect of life, they took it upon them to design the new world, one teapot at a time. What emerged was a vision for society in which citizens, architecture, product design, agriculture, entertainment, science and art would exist together in one unified, "rational" programme: Modernism. To the young people at the Bauhaus, this idea must have felt utterly within reach: In a country struggling to recover from the first World War, with violent revolutions going on in Europe and new technology changing every aspect of life, change seemed inevitable. (Moller, 2015)

How exactly that change should look like, the Bauhausler never quite agreed on. The early Bauhaus was driven by the search for individual expression. Johannes Itten, with his head shaved and wearing a robe of his own design taught the now-famous Vorkurs: Here, students developed their personal means of expression through meditation, philosophy and basic exercises.

The Bauhaus started to move toward a more collective outlook in 1922, when Theo van Doesburg, a proponent of De Stijl began teaching at the Bauhaus. He introduced the reduction to geometric shapes and primary colours that would become the basis of "Bauhaus Style". The following year Hungarian artist Laszlo Moholy-Nagy took over teaching of the preliminary course. He replaced much of Itten's individualistic curriculum with exercises using industrial material. In the following years, objectivity and scientific rigor remained the governing thought at the Bauhaus. (Droste, 1998)

However, this initial conflict between personal expression and collective-oriented decision making remained present in the Bauhaus. We can see it in disagreements between directors, teachers and students, with each side defending their position vehemently. It continued long after the Bauhaus disbaned in 1933 and its former students had spread all over the world. The term "living machine", coined by Le Corbusier in 1923 to describe an optimistic vision of the future, became a term of derision. Critics like Tom Wolfe described the International Style a purely academic exercise, unfit to meet the needs of the people. (Wolfe, 1981)

So did the ideas of modernism survive the Bauhaus? And if they did, how can we reconcile the orginal call for great social revolution of the 1920s with the reality of a deeply individualistic, heterogenous society?

To answer there questions, we must turn again to the physical artifacts of the Bauhaus. Of all the artistic output of the Bauhaus, architecture was the "ultimate goal" from the beginning. Over 50 building projects were completed by members of the Bauhaus between 1920 and 1933, and countless more after the war. A few of these buildings have become instantly recognisable: The Sommerfeld House (1920), the Haus am Horn (1923) and The Bauhaus Building and Master's houses in Dessau (1925-26). (Engels, 2001)

However, many more have escaped public attention for most of their existence. They were never regarded as architectural monuments, but used by the public like any other building - Many of them didn't receive heritage protection until very recently. As such they were altered, extended, worn down and painted over with little hesitation. We could lament this loss of architectural history (and people have), but in our search for evidence as to the success (or failure) of modernism, we couldn't get luckier. Here we have the physical manifestations of 1920s modernist ideals, tested mercilessly by regular people through decades of war, reconstruction and changing political regimes up to the present day. 

## The Dessau-Torten Estate

The example I will be discussing here is the housing estate Dessau-Torten. Designed by Walter Gropius from 1926 to 1928 and later expanded under Hannes Meyer, it provided housing to 314 families across roughly six square miles. (Worth pointing out that for all the peaceful future world the Bauhausler were imagening, a significant share of those people were building bombers in the local Junkers factory).

Torten was the first major project the Bauhaus would undertake after its move to Dessau in 1925. After the school was forced out of Weimar under right-wing pressure, the social-democratic government of Dessau had convinced Gropius to move the school there. Dessau was a growing industrial centre at the time, and the influx of workers had led to a housing shortage - The city government comissioned the Bauhaus to help address this. 

To Gropius, Torten was an opportunity to put his ideas to the test on a large scale. Torten became a test-case for new materials, organisation techniques and architectural language, with every department at the Bauhaus working towards it.

It is worth pointing out the inherent conflict here: Testing new technology would inevitably be more expensive and difficult in the short term than relying on traditional materials. This conflict will become apparent as we examine the alterations that became necsecary shortly after the initial construction.

When Gropius stepped down as director of the Bauhaus in 1927, Hannes Meyer continued work on the Torten Estate. The final phase of construction was completed in 1930, three years before the Bauhaus was forced to disband. Torten remained in use through the 20th century, undergoing significant changes throughout the years. It received heritage protection in 1994, which limits the extent of structural changes home-owners are allowed to make. Since 2000 a number of buildings have been restored to their original state.
