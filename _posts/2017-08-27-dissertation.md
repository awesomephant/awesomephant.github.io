intro: "The Bauhaus today is remembered mostly for its physical artifacts: Steel tube furniture, household appliances put together from geometric shapes, New Typography, all set against the backdrop of flat-roofed, pristine white architecture. The philosophical and political struggle that led to these outcomes seems distant to us. Reading some of the manifestos published at the Bauhaus, written in somewhat stilted 1920s German and printed in long lines of sans-serif type can only give us a faint idea of the monumental endeavour the Bauhausler were engaged in."

Having found themselves in a country still recovering from the first world war, with new technology changing every aspect of life, they took it upon them to design the new world, one teapot at a time. What emerged was a vision for society in which citizens, architecture, product design, agriculture, entertainment, science and art would exist together in one unified, "rational" programme: Modernism. To the young people at the Bauhaus, this idea must have felt utterly within reach: In a country struggling to recover from the first World War, with violent revolutions going on in Europe and new technology changing every aspect of life, change seemed inevitable. (Moller, 2015)

How exactly that change should look like, the Bauhausler never quite agreed on. The early Bauhaus was surprisingly well aligned with the earlier Arts and Crafts movement: Both the 1919 Bauhaus manifesto and the early curriculum show a move away from industrialisation back towards mediaval modes of working. In the manifesto, Gropius doesn't mention mass-production, the use of industrial materials or the rational design approach that is associated with the Bauhaus today. Instead, he calls for a renewed emphasis on craftsmanship, with a focus on individual artistic expression:

> Architects, sculptors, painters – we all must return to craftsmanship! For there is no such thing as 'art by profession'. There is no essential difference between the artist and the artisan. The artist is an exalted artisan. Merciful heaven, in rare moments of illumination beyond man’s will, may allow art to blossom from the work of his hand, but the foundations of proficiency are indispensable to every artist. 

This return to pre-industrial ways of working is reflected in the Bauhaus curriculum. Students were required to complete a six-month preliminary course taught by Johannes Itten. Here, students developed their personal means of expression through meditation, philosophy and basic artistic exercises. Following this experience, students were taught in the workshops by a "Master of Form" and a "Master of Craft" - following the model of mediaval craft guilds. (Lodder, 2006)

The Bauhaus started to move toward a more industrial outlook in 1922, when Theo van Doesburg, a proponent of the Dutch De Stijl began teaching at the Bauhaus. He introduced the reduction to geometric shapes and primary colours that would become the basis of "Bauhaus Style". The following year the Hungarian constructivist Laszlo Moholy-Nagy took over teaching of the preliminary course. He replaced much of Itten's individualistic curriculum with exercises using industrial material. In the following years, objectivity and scientific rigor remained the governing thought at the Bauhaus (Droste, 1998). It is this second school of thought - spread all over the world by former Bauhausler after 1933 - that defines much of the Bauhaus' legacy and continues to influence our built environment. 

The question I'm interested in addressing is this: At its core, modernism is based on a notion of social collectivism. By making rational decisions and leveraging mass production, so the thought goes, we could eventually arrive at universal solutions that improve everyone's life. But what happens when the products of that idea are exposed to regular people? Can there be such a thing as a mass-produced universal solution when the people inhabiting it are inherently driven to individualism? I'm particularly interested in how the answer to this question may have changed over time: The early 20th century saw the emergence of a fordist, industrialised economy. Now, a century later, we're seeing a transition to a service-driven economy in which production is increasingly automated. How does modernist architecture and the ideas asociated with it hold up against this background?

To answer these questions, we must turn again to the physical artifiacts of the historical Bauhaus. Careful examination of these artifacts and how they have fared over the last 100 years might allow us to draw conclusions on the larger, ideological concepts they manifest.

There is a wide range of physical artifacts we might chose look at: Bauhaus students were engaged in weaving, interior decoration, furniture-making as well as painting, graphic design and advertising, and many well-known products of these activities survive. We might, for instance, look at Marcel Breyer's steel tube chairs: The first iteration, known as "B3" was designed in 1925 following what might be called early ergonomic guidelines, recommending "angled position of the upper body" and "elastic seat and back rests". Early models were built in collaboration with local steel manufacturers from a cutting-edge material of the day: precision steel tube. In marketing material released in 1927 Breuer uses both the functionalist design approach and the use of industrial materials as primary selling points. (It's unclear how much post-rationalisation is going on here - Breuer tells a story about how the inspiration for the chair came from the handlebars of a friend's bicycle, which suggests a more formalist origin).

[...]

However, of all the disciplines taught at the Bauhaus, one stands out above all the others: "The ultimate goal of all art" at the Bauhaus, as Gropius declares in 1919, is architecture. Over 50 building projects were completed by members of the Bauhaus between 1919 and 1930, and countless mroe after the school disbanded (Engels, 2001). This count includes buildings that were built by Gropius and others relatively independently from the Bauhaus, but some were the result of the type of cross-discipline collaboration that was at the core of the Bauhaus idea. These large-scale projects addressed real-world issues (ie. housing shortages), while at the same time serving as classroom experiments at the Bauhaus.

A few of these buildings have become instantly recognisable: The Sommerfeld House (1920), the Haus am Horn (1923) and The Bauhaus Building and Master's houses in Dessau (1925-26). However, many more have escaped public attention for most of their existence. They were never regarded as architectural monuments, but used by the public like any other building - Many of them didn't receive heritage protection until very recently. As such they were altered, extended, worn down and painted over with little hesitation. We could lament this loss of architectural history (and people do), but in our search for evidence as to the success (or failure) of modernism, we couldn't get luckier. Here we have the physical manifestations of 1920s modernist ideals, tested mercilessly by regular people through decades of war, reconstruction and changing political regimes up to the present day. 

## Architecture at the Bauhaus

As mentioned above, architecture plays a central role in the 1919 Bauhaus manifesto. In it, Gropius calls for a "new unity of art and craft", the "ultimate goal" of which would be architecture. Despite the fact architecture formed the centre of Bauhaus ideas, it took Gropius three years (?) to establish a formal architecture department. Up to that point he had arranged for students to take classes at a traditional technical school in Weimar. 

The way architecture was taught at the Bauhaus changed significantly during its existence, reflecting shifts in thinking within the Bauhaus and the cultural landscape of Weimar.

[...]

This was reinforced from 1928, when Swiss architect Hannes Meyer took over the post of director from Walter Gropius. Meyer described archietcture not as an artistic problem, but one "of organisation", which he was determined to solve with mathematical accuracy. His architectural drawings are filled with tables and graphs describing the results of soil analysis, sunlight calculations and weather observations at the building site. 

## The Dessau-Torten Estate

The example I will be primarily discussing here is the housing estate Dessau-Torten. Designed by Walter Gropius and members of the Bauhaus, it consits of 314 single-family, two-story houses across roughly six square miles. The initial construction was completed in three phases from 1926 to 1928. (It is worth pointing out that for all the peaceful future world the Bauhausler were imagening, a significant share of those people were building bombers at the local Junkers factory). The estate was expanded under Hannes Meyer, who succeeded Gropius as Bauhaus director in 1928.

Torten was part of a national effort to provide affordable housing to lower-income families. Individual units in Torten were sold for between RM 9.500 and RM 10.100 - well within the reach of an average industrial worker (Gropius, 1930). The fact that units were sold off individually is ciritcal to our analysis of Torten over time. Individual ownership meant that units could be altered individually with few restrictions, which happened almost immediately after the inital construction and continues to present day. 

The layering of changes over decades has led to the estate would be almost unrecognisable from the original photographs. Since the 1990s a number of buildings have been bought by the city government and restored to their original state, but the vast majority remain in private ownership. (Schwarting, Matz 2012)

## Initial Construction

Torten was the first major project the Bauhaus would undertake after its move from Weimar to Dessau. This was by design: The city government had convinced Gropius to move the school to Dessau with the explicit goal of building social housing. This was part of a concerted effort to address a housing shortage caused by an influx of workers that had increased Dessau's population by 50% between 1917 and 1927.

Torten was a conflicted project in a number of ways.

While the Dessau government was looking for a pragmatic solution to a housing shortage, Gropius saw an opportunity to test ideas on archiectural language, construction technology and organisation on a large scale. Torten was as much a pragmatic response to a housing shortage as it was a test-environment for Bauhaus ideas - this contradiction became apparent almost immediately after initial construction.

There is also a disconnect between Gropius decidedly modern architectural language and the overall conception of the development, which is that of a garden city - an idea first brought forward in Britain in the 19th century.

But most importantly, Torten might be an ideal site to find an answer to our original question.  Here is a housing development consisting of hundreds of mass-manufactured, scientifically conceived units, marketed toward industrial workers - a realisation of modernist ideals. And unlike other Bauhaus products, it never became a museum piece but remained in use to present day. 

## Alterations in the 1920s
Following the initial construction, heat insulation quickly became a concern. This was largely a result of shortcomings in the construction

1. The steel frame, single glass windows chosen by Gropius were cutting-edge technology at the time. As such, they were not only a third more expensive than traditional wooden windows but also caused major heat loss due to their size and lack of insulation. Most of the original windows were replaced by more traditional ones as early as 1932
2. The thin outer walls formed another heat escape route. This was a direct result of their industrial production - because they all had the same dimensions, heat bridges formed between the gaps. Home-ownders addressed this by errecting secondary brick facades shortly after the initial construction.

## Alterations in the GDR

Rebuilding after bombing in the second world war, people used as much orginal material as possible due to shortage.

More people got cars, so they put up garages and carports in the back gardens - at the same time self-sufficiency became less of a thing. The gravel path between the gardens becomes a secondary road.


## Alterations after 1989
DIY-retail
Self sufficiency definitely not a thing anymore
mass-produced diy stuff maybe the closest we've come to gropius' idea of life-size building blocks.
Recognition of architectural heritage, some of the buildings have been aquired by the local government and returned to their original state. legislation has been put in place to prevent major structural changes, although as Schwarting points out this has its own set of problems - some of the regulations prescribe things that are inconsistent with the original drawings.
