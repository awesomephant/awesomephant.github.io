intro: "The Bauhaus today is remembered mostly for its physical artifacts: Steel tube furniture, household appliances put together from geometric shapes, New Typography, all set against the backdrop of flat-roofed, pristine white architecture. The philosophical and political struggle that led to these outcomes seems distant to us. Reading some of the manifestos published at the Bauhaus, written in somewhat stilted 1920s German and printed in long lines of sans-serif type can only give us a faint idea of the monumental endeavour the Bauhausler were engaged in."

Having found themselves in a country still recovering from the first world war, with new technology changing every aspect of life, they took it upon them to design the new world, one teapot at a time. What emerged was a vision for society in which citizens, architecture, product design, agriculture, entertainment, science and art would exist together in one unified, "rational" programme: Modernism. To the young people at the Bauhaus, this idea must have felt utterly within reach: In a country struggling to recover from the first World War, with violent revolutions going on in Europe and new technology changing every aspect of life, change seemed inevitable. (Moller, 2015)

How exactly that change should look like, the Bauhausler never quite agreed on. The early Bauhaus was driven by the search for individual expression. Johannes Itten, with his head shaved and wearing a robe of his own design taught the now-famous Vorkurs: Here, students developed their personal means of expression through meditation, philosophy and basic exercises. This

The Bauhaus started to move toward a more collective outlook in 1922, when Theo van Doesburg, a proponent of De Stijl began teaching at the Bauhaus. He introduced the reduction to geometric shapes and primary colours that would become the basis of "Bauhaus Style". The following year Hungarian artist Laszlo Moholy-Nagy took over teaching of the preliminary course. He replaced much of Itten's individualistic curriculum with exercises using industrial material. In the following years, objectivity and scientific rigor remained the governing thought at the Bauhaus (Droste, 1998).

The question now, close to 100 years after the Bauhaus was founded is this: Did the ideas of modernism as conceived in the 1920s stand the test of time? How does the utopian vision of a "rational", collectivist society fare in the modern world which is simultaneously defined by industrial production and (perceived) individualism? To answer these questions, we must turn again to the physical artifiacts of the historical Bauhaus. Careful examination of these artifacts and how they have fared over the last 100 years might allow us to draw conclusions on the larger, ideological concepts they manifest.

There is a wide range of physical artifacts we might chose look at: Bauhaus students were engaged in weaving, interior decoration, furniture-making as well as painting, graphic design and advertising, and many well-known products of these activities survive. We might, for instance, look at Marcel Breyer's steel tube chairs: The first iteration, known as "B3" was designed in 1925 following what might be called early ergonomic guidelines, recommending "angled position of the upper body" and "elastic seat and back rests". Early models were built in collaboration with local steel manufacturers from a cutting-edge material of the day: precision steel tube. In marketing material released in 1927 Breuer uses both the functionalist design approach and the use of industrial materials as primary selling points. (It's unclear how much post-rationalisation is going on here - Breuer tells a story about how the inspiration for the chair came from the handlebars of a friend's bicycle, which suggests a more formalist origin).

Either way, the B3 chair is to some extent ...

However of all the disciplines taught at the Bauhaus, one stands out above all the others: "The ultimate goal of all art" at the Bauhaus, as Gropius declares in 1919, is architecture. Over 50 building projects were completed by members of the Bauhaus between 1919 and 1930, and countless mroe after the school disbanded (Engels, 2001). This count includes buildings that were built by Gropius and others relatively independently from the Bauhaus, but some were the result of the type of cross-discipline collaboration that was at the core of the Bauhaus idea. These large-scale projects addressed real-world issues (ie. housing shortages), while at the same time serving as classroom experiments at the Bauhaus.

A few of these buildings have become instantly recognisable: The Sommerfeld House (1920), the Haus am Horn (1923) and The Bauhaus Building and Master's houses in Dessau (1925-26). However, it is the more obscure examples of Bauhaus architecture 

However, many more have escaped public attention for most of their existence. They were never regarded as architectural monuments, but used by the public like any other building - Many of them didn't receive heritage protection until very recently. As such they were altered, extended, worn down and painted over with little hesitation. We could lament this loss of architectural history (and people do), but in our search for evidence as to the success (or failure) of modernism, we couldn't get luckier. Here we have the physical manifestations of 1920s modernist ideals, tested mercilessly by regular people through decades of war, reconstruction and changing political regimes up to the present day. 

## Architecture at the Bauhaus

As mentioned above, architecture plays a central role in the 1919 Bauhaus manifesto. In it, Gropius calls for a "new unity of art and craft", the "ultimate goal" of which would be architecture. Paradoxically, it took Gropius three years (?) to establish a formal architecture department - Up to that point he had arranged for students to take classes at a traditional technical school in Weimar. 

This was reinforced from 1928, when Swiss architect Hannes Meyer took over the post of director from Walter Gropius. Meyer described archietcture not as an artistic problem, but one "of organisation", which he was determined to solve with mathematical accuracy. His architectural drawings are filled with tables and graphs describing the results of soil analysis, sunlight calculations and weather observations at the building site.

## The Dessau-Torten Estate

The example I will be primarily discussing here is the housing estate Dessau-Torten. Designed by Walter Gropius from 1926 to 1928 and later expanded under Hannes Meyer, it provided housing to 314 families across roughly six square miles. (Worth pointing out that for all the peaceful future world the Bauhausler were imagening, a significant share of those people were building bombers in the local Junkers factory).

Torten was the first major project the Bauhaus would undertake after its move from Weimar to Dessau in 1925. After the Bauhaus had been forced out of Weimar under right-wing pressure, the social-democratic government of Dessau had convinced Gropius to move the school there with the explicit goal of creating social housing. Dessau, like other cities at the time experienced an influx of industrial workers was faced with a housing shortage caused by growing industry at the time. 

To Gropius, Torten was an opportunity to put his ideas to the test on a large scale. Torten became a test-case for new materials, organisation techniques and architectural language, with every department at the Bauhaus working towards it.

It is worth pointing out the inherent conflict here: Testing new technology would inevitably be more expensive and difficult in the short term than relying on traditional materials. This conflict will become apparent as we examine the alterations that became necsecary shortly after the initial construction.

When Gropius stepped down as director of the Bauhaus in 1927, Hannes Meyer continued work on the Torten Estate. The final phase of construction was completed in 1930, three years before the Bauhaus was forced to disband.  

It received heritage protection in 1994, which limits the extent of structural changes home-owners are allowed to make. Since 2000 a number of buildings have been restored to their original state. (Schwarting, Matz 2012)

## Alterations in the 1920s
Almost immediately following the initial construction, heat insulation became a major issue. This had two reasons related directly to Gropius' architectural vision:

1. The steel frame windows chosen by Gropius were at the time grounbreaking technology - as such they were not only more expensive than more traditional wooden window frames, but also 

## Alterations in the GDR

Rebuilding after bombing in the second world war, people used as much orginal material as possible due to shortage.

More people got cars, so they put up garages and carports in the bacl gardens - at the same time self-sufficiency became less of a thing. The gravel path between the gardens becomes a secondary road.


## Alterations after 1989
DIY-retail (details on shops, maybe do a map?)
Self sufficiency definitely not a thing anymore
mass-produced diy stuff maybe the closest we've come to gropius' idea of life-size building blocks. (photos of examples, diagram)
Recognition of architectural heritage, some of the buildings have been aquired by the local government and returned to their original state. legislation has been put in place to prevent major structural changes, although as Schwarting points out this has its own set of problems - some of the regulations prescribe things that are inconsistent with the original drawings. Maybe bring up tehe issue of colour here - we only have black and white photographs of the buildings giving the impression that they were all pristine white, when in reality they maybe had quite subtle colour choices.

(interesting maybe to talk about moholy nagys meisterhaus, which was destroyued in the second world war. instead of rebuilding it as it was, they put a concrete cast - rachel whiteread style)

## Conclusion

Dessau torten isn't a clear cut case, they had to make compromises on materials, steel windows weren't as good as they are today, the concrete they made on site wasn't gerat etc. but it was all going in the correct direction. Stress the organisational aspect, also the fact it was governement funded is maybe a new thing? Basically the idea that modernism has survived in the sense that the torten buildings are flexible enough to be changed. maybe the futurist idea that part of their movement was the idea that the movement would eventually die. Socialism hasn't happened obviously, but this wasn't always the intention of teh bauhaus, moholy nagy was more in favour of working with industry. notion of using rationale, science to make architecture cheaper has survived, although the idea of big social housing developments isn't as popular anymore (maybe show chemistry worker's city by former bauhausler, la housing blocks as examples)

Inequality, housing shortages today, people aren't as afraid of socialism anymore. Society has progressed from a Fordian industrial workforce to a service economy - production and transportation is more and more automated, posing the question wether the way we live needs to change in a major way again.  Maybe the young-odl thing is a major point to be made here - people living in a collective way, in pre-frabricated houses (ie. RVs, also there has to be  a russian constructivist flying house version of RVs, also the theme parks are a bit like a housing estate, you even buy into a certain social programme and dress code when you live in one of those places - compare hannes Meyer's trade union school where he used scoiology to determin people should live in groups of certain sizes and built the whole environment based on that)
