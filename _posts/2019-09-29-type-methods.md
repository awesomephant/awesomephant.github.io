## 7 November
Hoping to develop a typeface out of this lettering I did:

Maybe also take some stuff from [Node Paint](http://www.maxkoehler.com/node-paint/) (extended pen nib).

Above might be useful for bold weights down the line.

- Like the contrast in the *H* and *A*.
- Horizontal stress

V1 of the uppercase nearly finished. I'm trying to keep the wiggles in the same position vertically, so I can eventually kern the letters into each other like I did in the original lettering. Consistency is good, but might lead to the letters looking too similar (boring).

The number of wiggles (left-right-left from top to bottom) makes the letters quite busy â€” maybe number of squiggles could relate to optical size? I like them in the *O* and *R*, much too pointy in "W" and "A". Weight also inconsistent.
