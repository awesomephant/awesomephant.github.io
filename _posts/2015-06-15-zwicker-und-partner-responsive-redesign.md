    -   title: Content Inventory
        description: Zwicker & Partner has a content-heavy site with lots of articles for patients and medical professionals. With the content inventory, we’ll be able to work out which content is the most valuable and which might need to be revised or updated. Based on that we’ll figure out the content strategy for the new site.
