# Notes on the Tate Archive

- Central artifact of the archive is the filing cabinet, not the photograph (Sekula)
- Who writes descriptions for every page of every sketchbook?
- Stuff is organised on multiple record levels: Fond > Sub-Fond > Series > Sub-Series > File > Item > Single Item
- There's a big list of [uncatalogued collections](http://archive.tate.org.uk/TateArchiveUncatCollList.pdf).
- There are more than a million items, 52,000 of which are digitised.
- There are 720 top-level collections
