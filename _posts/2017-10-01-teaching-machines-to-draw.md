Turns out my steppers and drivers worked just fine, I just didn't have enough voltage. 9V battery does the trick. I also found out my first EasyDriver is in fact perfectly fine, which is good news.

Managed to solder pins on my EasyDrivers, they fit nicely into the breadboards now. Hopefully I didn't cook any of the components.

I found out you can get AutoCAD for free as a student, so I used that to draw up the shaft supports I need to build. What a good piece of software. (I can't believe I ever thought it was a good idea to do this in Illustrator)

Bought some more components to help with the wood:

- 1 x 16mm Auger bit (To drill a hole that will take a ball bearing)
- 1 x 8mm General purpose bit (to make supports for the slide shafts)
- Mounting brackets
- Machine screws

Had a good talk with a technician at Camberwell today concerning cutting my MDF (shouldn't be a problem) and drilling holes for my shaft supports (might be a problem). Turns out the 40cm drill bit I bought yesterday is going to be useless - you can chuck it in a drill press, but because it's so long it will wobble and make it impossible to drill a precise hole. The workshop has some special drill router bits that should work better. 

Cutting the 5mm steel rod isn't a problem, he says. I'm starting to think having two shafts at the end might be useful, it allows me to tighten each timing belt seperately (but then again I'm increasing friection and I could probably cut both belts to the same lengths with reasonable precision)

Workshops are closed Wednesday afternoons, and they're doing inductions Thursday - So I'll be cutting my MDF Friday afternoon.

Also I held some screws up agains things and found out that I do have the correct machine screws to go in my linear bearings, and my wood screws will fit in my angle brackets.

Got my MDF cut to size - turns out I couldn't get 15 pieces because you loose 3mm with each cut (the width of the saw blade). I managed to put together a version of the slide mechanism using MDF blocks and mounting brackets.

Because the rods are so long, there is quite a lot of springy-ness to them - hoping this won't be too much of a problem since there isn't going to be much weight on them.

### Problems:

 - It's difficult to get the MDF blocks to sit straight using mounting brackets - it always pulls them in one direction or the other
 - MDF doesn't work too well as a shaft support - the rods move around in the holes, causing the slide to get stuck.

I've ordered some machine-made [aluminium shaft supports](https://www.gearsandsprockets.co.uk/pillar-shaft-support-mount-for-linear-guide-rails-8mm-sk8uu.html) which should solve both problems at the same time.

Hoping to install the drive shaft (with temporary support) and do a test with the motor by the end of next week.
