intro: "Earlier this year (towards the end of my undergrad) I started to record some notes on [machine learning applications and the datasets that power them](/2018/feret-database/). While I did find some interesting artifacts (see the FERET database) and read some good articles (such as [The Body and the Archive](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/778312.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A53f6ebc3ba7c0f02e549d2dd321beee4)), I never managed to really train and use a neural network in practice."

I did experiment with some pre-built networks, such as [DCGAN](https://github.com/carpedm20/DCGAN-tensorflow) by and [char-rnn](https://github.com/sherjilozair/char-rnn-tensorflow), but I didn't really undestand what was happening under the surface. More importantly, I couldn't modify these networks to change their outputs (apart from tweaking some hyperparameters).

The focus of the next few months is going to be to change that. As with [earlier projects](/2017/teaching-machines-to-draw/), I will be taking notes here as I go along.
