On Visual Essays

A definition of illustration: Any image that takes a communicating role in a text. Text meaning words or images or both.

## Constructing an argument with images

[St. Jerome in his study]
Writing about it in "Writing with images"
Illustrations that are used in art history writing. A mnemonic: An image to remind us what an image looks like. Diesn't have to be a v good reproduction. THe other way is evidence. Both of these aren't v exciting

- Images arranged on a timeline: a visual argument
You start seeing images referencing each other (chronology)

**Details of different images next to each other**
You start seeing repetition etc

David Carrier: The aestetics of comics
Talks about the idea of concatenation of images: Whenever we see images in the same context we start making connections. The visual essay can build on this.

St Jerome by Lucas Chranach the Elder

**Direct comparison**
**Introducing a new (diagrammatic) voice** to make an argument

Semantic Sesseation: When you say a word over and over again and it stops soundning like a word. The same works for images: Image becomes a pattern. Graphic novels have this convention where a full bleed image is timeless (Scott McCloud: UNderstanding Comics). Devices like this can be used to make critical arguments also.

Using book rythm, pacing etc. If the reader thinks they know what's coming, you can emphasise a point by making something different. All of this is repetition.

**Space**
In graphic novels, white space slows down time
We're talking about space in a spatial medium.
Spacing also creates hierarchy. You can do headline, body copy and sidenotes with images. Using typographic conventions with images. All of the structure of an essay is still there, you can use it with images as well.
This hinges on reading direction.

**Extraction**
PUlling out parts of the image (tracing, distortion etc) to make a point

**Direct comparison**
Brian Dyllan: Essayism
Talks about ways to write essays: One of these is the list (ie most of the stuff above)
Visual essays allow us to demonstrate arguments rather than describing them

Overlaying images that have visual similarities

**Historical Comparison**
Pull in images from a different context to make comparisons

George Preck on St Jerome

**Reduction, Elimination**
Cut out parts of the image. You draw attention to what's been cut out, and also the stuff around it.

## Visual Grammar
Sarah Sze: Midnight Mexico City

Using found structure (such as the grid of a newspaper)
John Berger: Ways of Seeing

Richard McGuire: Here (2014)
Looking at the same corner of a room in different time periods.
[Spread with dancers]
Using time, layering of different narratives

Hollis Frampton: Nostalgia

Spiegelman in early in raw "Don't get around much anymore" (A character talking about what happened in the last panel) plays on a similar idea.
Rachel Moore on the Frampton film

Cindy Sherman's instagram
It's not (a concsious essay) but an essay
One of the rare old artist who's doing good things on INstagram
Using digital platforms to inform visual essays
Instagram has a grd, which is a visual grammar you can mae use of.

## Performance

Visual Essays don't have to happen in a book. ie. Nostalgia is a visual essay.
