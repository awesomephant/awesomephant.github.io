<p class='full note'>
	Apparently this statement isn't completely awful. Since this post was published, I got multiple offers, including one from Camberwell College of Arts (Part of the University of the Arts London) were I will start studying graphic design in September 2015.

When people ask why I want to go into graphic design, I always end up telling the same story.

It's about the time me and a couple of friends were in London for an orchestra exchange with Hampton School, Richmond in the summer of 2014 (I had just gotten into first violin at the time). Our schedule was packed with rehearsals and concerts, so it wasn't until the last day that we actually got to explore central London. We had around six hours, an all-zone tube ticket each and a huge list of things we wanted to see.
We rushed from Harrods to the British Museum, to some train station that apparently shows up in the Harry Potter movies back to Hyde Park where out coach was waiting. None of us had ever been to London before, so we felt incredibly smart for finding our way around the city so easily, hopping from one train onto another without stopping or looking at the tube map.
The twist happens when I get to the part of the story where we get back to the coach the evening, and the entire orchestra tells the exact same story. Everybody has had the same smooth, empowering experience getting around London. Everybody felt smart. Everybody felt safe. Then I say something like: "We weren't actually smart. The people who designed the signage systems in the tube were the smart ones. Us, and everybody else finding their way around London each day, that's the result of good design work."

This is probably where I should end the story, but I usually can't help but talk about Harry Beck's tube map, or Johnston Sans, or colour theory while my audience slowly backs away.

The point is this: I want to become a designer to help people get stuff done. To me, design isn't about aesthetics, it's about solving problems within constraints. I find the seats at train stations far more interesting design-wise than the ones that sell for thousands of pounds at "designer stores". I find Bell Centennial (the typeface specifically designed to be readable on low-quality phonebook paper) far more exciting than Helvetica Neue (the typeface that looks cool in bold).

Sure, I love playing around with typefaces, colours and shapes. I experiment with photography, illustration and digital interfaces. I also love art (I once spent two days at the Art Institute of Chicago looking at European Impressionists when I should have actually done christmas shopping). But ultimately, I want to go beyond playing around, beyond making things look nice and actually make an impact.

I think going to university will allow me to get a lot closer to that goal. I can't wait to jump in.
