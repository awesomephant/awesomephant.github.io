intro: "I just noticed Google Photos on desktop is doing an interesting thing about the way you select images."
---

Selecting files in most desktop operating systems works like this: You click a file to select it. When you select a different file, it *deselects the first one*. To select multiple files, you either hold shift and click or drag open a box.

In Google Photos[^1] it's different. You can click an image to select it, but if you click on another image it *adds that second image to your selection*. When you click a third image, it adds that to your selection, too.

This idea isn’t new. It’s a widely adopted pattern across mobile operating systems, and for good reason:

1. A phone has no shift key to hold down to select multiple images. Boxing multiple files would likely be a difficult thing to do with just your finger on a small screen.
2. Tapping lots of items on a phone screen feels natural and is considerably faster than clicking the same amount of files with a mouse on a desktop.

It’s interesting to see an interface that was originally designed around the limited input methods of a mobile device moved back to a desktop application. I think we're going to see a lot more of that, soon.

Touch is now the default. Phones and tablets have been outselling desktop PCs for a while[^2], and more and more new desktop PCs have touch screens. People have become extremely proficient at using touch screens and interface patterns like the one I described have become part of our muscle memory. Mouse and keyboard as primary input methods, and interfaces that rely on those input methods have an uncertain future.

##A physical keyboard is an opportunity for progressive enhancement.

If you hold down the shift key in Google photos, you can select multiple images with one click. Google Drive lets you delete documents using the delete-key on the keyboard and shows a context menu if you right-click a file. But these interactions are just additions to a core experience that  doesn’t rely on them.

Google Photos is the first web app I’ve seen that’s clearly designed touch-first. I think that’s going to be the way to go moving forward.
