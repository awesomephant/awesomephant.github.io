- *Empire* by Andy Warhol basically started *structuralist film*
- P. Adams Sitney coins the term, see also [Structural Film Antology](https://monoskop.org/images/6/65/Gidal_Peter_ed_Structural_Film_Anthology.pdf) by Peter Gidal
- A lot of structuralist film came out of the London film-makers co-op
- *[Room Film 1973](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axucqo_SNLo)* by Peter Gidal. He's showing the same shot over and over again — back then a hugely laborious thing to do (you'd have to physically make copies of the film). This is *film about film*, exposing the underlying mechanics of film-making, or *film as film*.
- *[Ray Gun Virus (1966)](https://vimeo.com/17173209)* by Paul Sharits
- *[Dresden Dynamo (1971)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7xoNWzm7PQ)* by Rhodes Lis. Note that the sound comes from her drawing directly onto the film (which contains sound information in visual form).
- *[Berlin Horse (1970)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDj8Tc6259o)* by Malcom Le Grice

All of these people are making work about analogue film — digital images work entirely differently:

Multiple pixels, with RGB-coloured filters are needed to capture colour images. [Source](https://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-resources/astrophotography-tips/redeeming-color-planetary-cameras/)

Cameras (especially phones) apply all kinds of digital optimisations to images: Simple things like bringing up the saturation, increasing the contrast, but also more advanced operations like smooting out skin, morphing bodyparts to make them look more "attractive".

When images are shared online, there's additional processes like scaling and compression. Any screen you look at a photograph on is doing its own, interanl optimisations to it.

All of this is to say, digital images have a limited link with reality (certainly not the chemical index that analogue material represents).

Let's make a digital film that explores some of the inherent characteristics of digital images (in the same way the structuralists made films abotu analogue film-making).
