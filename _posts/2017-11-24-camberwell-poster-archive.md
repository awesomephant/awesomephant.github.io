## November 24, 2017

I've had this idea to do a digital archive of all the posters that have been designed at Camberwell over the years (Perhaps this could be expanded to include other colleges down the line), similar to the [RCA Poster Archive](https://rca-poster-archive.co.uk/), designed by [Tom Finn](http://tomfinn.co.uk) earlier this year. He describes it as follows:

> RCAPA is a generative online Archive catalogue, which holds several thousand posters from the last 80 Years at the Royal College of Art. Upon entering the site, the Catalogue presents the user with a new selection of images based upon predefined characteristics, which aims to allow for more of a serendipitous approach towards working with an archival collection. It will also provide current students at the RCA to upload new work to the archive, and outside visitors to edit or comment on existing posters to provide new understanding around the work.

Sounds pretty cool. Here's me asking the special collections librarian at Camberwell if this is a stupid idea:

> Hi Gustavo,
>I’m a 3rd year student on BA Graphic Design at Camberwell. James Edgar pointed me in your direction to ask about this project idea I have:
>I’m thinking of compiling a digital archive of posters designed at Camberwell – similar to the RCA Poster Archive or the Cooper-Hewitt Collection. Ideally this would include historical posters as well as recent ones, and be accessible to the public outside the university.
>Before I get into the specific issues this might entail, my basic question is this:
>Do you think this is a feasible / worthwhile project to do?
>Perhaps we could have a chat next week and talk about things in more detail? Thanks for your help!
>Kind regards,
