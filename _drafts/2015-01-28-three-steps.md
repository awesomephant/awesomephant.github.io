I had this random thought when I was watching an old interview with Paul Rand. Designers seem to go through three distinct phases when it comes to talking about and explaining their work.

##1. I can make things look cool


##2. I'm super smart and my design work is SCIENCE
People at this stage will be happy to tell you all about how their logo is built on an isometrical 7x4 grid that represents the company's five core values. And how their typography is totally based on the golden ratio. They love to hide their logos behind all sorts of crazy circles and construction lines.[^1]

There's no point in telling someone what tools you used for a design, other than making yourself look smart and intimidating.

Doctors used to speak latin 

##3. I can make things look cool

When Paul Rand is asked about why he added the iconic 9 stripes to the IBM logo, his answer is "it just looked right".

When you're able to make well-informed descisions and confident enough to present those without rubbing your elaborated design process into everyone's faces, I think you're in a good place. 

[^1]: When Yahoo announced their new logo, they even made an entire [video of crazy construction lines](http://youtu.be/_0b6qaPY-CQ) lines. Jessica Hische's [comment](https://twitter.com/jessicahische/status/375649552201564160) is pretty golden.
