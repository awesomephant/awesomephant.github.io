Designers seem to go through three distinct phases when it comes to talking about and explaining their work.

##1. I can make things look cool
In many professions, things seem very difficult in the beginning but get easier over time. I remember listening to Vivaldi's Four Seasons as a child and thinking I couldn't possibly ever play them. After ten years of practice it turns out they aren't actually that difficult.

In design, it's the other way around. When I *aquired*[^1] a copy of Helvetica Neue and decreased the kerning, I felt like I had figured out design. I'd nudge things around until it happened to look cool, throw some random colours at it and call it a day. Good times.

##2. I'm super smart and my design work is *Science*
People at this stage will be happy to tell you all about how their logo is built on an isometrical 7x4 grid that represents the company's five core values. And how their typography is totally based on the golden ratio. They don't just show you the logo they made, they show you a million crazy circles and construction lines, too.[^2]

##3. I can make things look cool

In the interview I was watching, Paul Rand is asked about why the IBM logo. Specifically, why he added the iconic 9 stripes to it. His reponse is "it just looked right".
The Steve Jobs biography[^3] has a similar story about the logo for NeXT Computers. They paid Rand a quarter million dollars, and a few months later he showed up with the finished logo. No 3 different options, no talk about how it would represent the brand, no angled photos of the logo on a tote bag . Just "Here's your logo".[^4]

I'm sure Rand did use grids and construction lines when he made those logos. But he didn't use that stuff to prove to his clients that what he's doing is hard. Just like a radiologist doesn't hand you a circuit diagram of his MRI machine before he tells you about your broken leg.

I don't think many people get to a point where they can be as confident as Paul Rand. But when you're able to make well-informed descisions and *confident enough* to sell those without rubbing your elaborated design process into everyone's faces, I think you're in a good place.

[^2]: When Yahoo announced their new logo, they even made an entire [video of crazy construction lines](http://youtu.be/_0b6qaPY-CQ) lines. Jessica Hische's [comment](https://twitter.com/jessicahische/status/375649552201564160) is pretty golden.

[^4]: To be fair, Rand provided [some explanation](https://twitter.com/awesomephant/status/557830454175629313) of his descisions on the NeXT logo. But it's about as far from the crazy Yahoo! video as imaginable. No construction lines to be found.
