intro: I just finished Jason Santa Maria's latest book, “On Web Typography”. Here's what I took away from it.

I read the book over the course of a couple of days. The first chapter, titled "How we Read" at home on my laptop. The next two or three at work on some crappy Android tablet I stole from a conference room. I finished it on a crowded bus on my phone. Spreading the reading experience out over different devices and contexts like that isn't uncommon today. In fact, that's the way most people read.

Web typography has to account for all these different factors and create a reading experience that's pleasant and doesn't get in the way of what people are trying to do.

##There's a reason for curly quotes
Curly quotes or, as Santa Maria calls them, "smart quotes" always seemed to me like one of those things only designers would care about. Normal people won't even notice the difference between curly and straight quotes, right? Wrong. They make your shit easier to read for everyone. In fact, straight quotes were only invented when typewriters came up and manufacturers had to save space on the keyboard.

Typography has lots of little details like this, and each of them makes the reading experience a bit better.

##Good typography pays off
There's this point in the very first chapter that I had never thought of: If your content is hard to read, people prpbably won't read it. If your typography fails, your design fails. As Santa Maria puts it "they're just one click away from cat GIFs".

##I Should Probably Buy a Typeface
Making good typefaces takes skill and time. That's why those typefaces cost money.
