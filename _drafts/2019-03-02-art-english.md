### Collaboration

Also known as working together.

### Practice

Referred to by the rest of the world as *work*.

See also: Practitioner

### Practitioner

A practitioner is anyone who does anything - consider being more specific: Designer, artist, sculptor, photographer.

See also: Practice

### -based
A performance-based work is *performative*, a collaboration-based one is more succinctly described as *collaborative*. A *story-based photographer* is a photographer who tells stories.

### Space
Unless you're talking about *outer space*, consider room, building, or landscape.

### Narrative

Substitute story.

### Materiality

Can often be substituted for a more descriptive word: Surface, consistency, material.

### Exhibition

This is fine, but consider *show* if you want to sound less bourgois.

### Research

*Primary*, *secondary* and *tertiary* research are carried out by conducting experiments, reading papers, and reading summaries of papers, respectively. You may well begin a project with *tertiary* research.

### Publication

*Publication* means nothing.

If your publication is printed, it's either a book, or a zine, or a poster. An *online publication* is a website. If your publication documents a show, it's probably a *catalogue*.

### Zine

A short, printed publication, typically cheaply produced. If you're making more than one issue, consider calling it a magazine. I don't know what a fanzine is.
