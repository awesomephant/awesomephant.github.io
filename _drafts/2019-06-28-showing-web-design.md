## Let's look at some options

These are the methods I've seen other people use to present web design work, listed in order of elaborate-ness.

### Linking to the live site

This requires the least amount of effort on your side, and arguably it gives people the most accurate impression of your work. They can click around the site, look at animations, and see your design work at different screen sizes by resizing their browser. They could even look at things like loading times and accesibility if they were so inclined.

The biggest potential downside is that you can only really link to one page - typically the homepage. If you spent weeks designing a beautiful article template, people looking through your portfolio might never see it. This becomes even more of an issue when you're working on any kind of app. In that case most of your work probably lives behind some login system, making it difficult for people looking at your portfolio to access.

Even if you're using some other presentation method, it can't hurt to throw in a link to the site in addition. Should you set the link to open in a new tab? [Probably not](https://css-tricks.com/use-target_blank/).

### Screenshots

In my experience, screenshots are probably the most popular way to show web design work. There's a whole range of ways to do screenshots:

### The windowless screenshot
Can be either fullheight or partial height

### The illustrated browser screenshot

A sub-genre of this is the isometric-on-flat-brackground shot:

You definitely want to set your desktop background to a nice colour and make your browser window look as clean as possible: hide the bookmarks bar, close all other tabs, hide all plugin icons. It might even be worth usign a different browser that has a nicer interface. Chrome and Safari seem to be pretty popular though.

### The full device mockup

These can also be animated, which is useful to show flows and things:

This often comes in the form of _the triad_:

I think these are fairly easy to make when you're working in something like Framer? But if you design directly in code (like I do), this means messing around with screen recording and editing software.

As far as device images go, Facebook seems to have by far the [nicest ones](https://facebook.design/devices). [Also](https://facebook.design/handskit.html#filters)

### The device-in-hand-in-coffeeshop

Facebook seems to do this a lot. Maybe it works because we're already broadly familiar with their interface? If you're doing this, I think it has to be a real photo (or a *very* good mockup) because this sort of thing just looks cheesy:

The problem I have with all of these is that they don't really reflect how we design websites.

I like the Dropbox idea of [designing interfaces in a simluated desktop enivronment](). As Zach Johnston explains:

> While it’s great to present work in a sanitized format, it’s also important to remember that those scenarios don’t actually exist. In fact, a user’s environment is usually a busy, distraction-prone space. It may not be pretty, but it’s closer to what our users will actually experience. New emails coming in by the minute, calendar alerts telling you to run to your next meeting, and dozens of Chrome tabs nagging you about tasks you shouldn’t forget. It’s a wonder anyone gets work done. [...] At Dropbox, we found that simply presenting our work with a realistic desktop environment behind the design surfaced new ideas and challenged the way we thought about desktop interfaces.

They're using this primarily as a design tool, but maybe it would be an good way of displaying work as well. Though making clear what is your work and what's "scenery" might be difficult.
