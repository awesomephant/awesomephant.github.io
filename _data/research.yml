- title: "Shin Dokho: Poster"
  description: I wish I could read Korean to figure out what this poster is about. But I love the combination of huge, blown-out type that catches attention with smaller, accurate copt to convey information. I find that work that's limited in some way (in this case, only two colours and no imagery) is often the most interesting.

  description: I like how the lettering blends in with the illustration and creates this abstract but dark image of a river.

  description: This spread is from a handset, manually printed edition of Moby Dick. The small typographic details in the image captions, footnotes, subheadings, pagenumbers and so on create this incredibly rich feeling that only reminds me of handwritten books of the middle ages.

- title: "Tim Enthoven: NYT Magazine Cover (Art Direction by Arem Duplessis)"
  description: Love the fact all 1028 people on this cover are hand-drawn and unique. It creates this dense, random pattern without a real point of focus that's very unusual an eye-catching (Which, of course, is the point of a magaine cover).

- title: "Ken Briggs: Booking Leaflets for the National Theatre (1966)"
  description: "Ken Briggs' work has all the clear hierarchy and focus on information of Josef MÃ¼ller-Brockmann, but adds a certain playfulness that I really enjoy. I read that Briggs designed these leaflets to fit exactly into the inner pocket of a dinner jacket, which I find amazing."

- title: "Annie Leibovitz: Star Wars"
  description: Anni Leibovitz's work is always amazing. Her pictures have this rough, unpolished feeling to them. I love this photo in particular because it creates this amazing contrast between the reality and fiction. On one hand, we see the snowtroopers and Adam Driver all in full costume in what essentially looks like a still from the movie. But there's also those little street lights in the background reminding us that we're in fact on a film set on planet earth. It's surreal and I love it. (Plus, it's Star Wars so hey.)

  description: 'I was looking at this on some random tumblr when my dad walked by and went "Hey, that looks familliar". It reminded him of displays he saw in Everglades National Park when he was a kid. Turns out, those displays and this print are in fact both from American illustrator Charley Harper'

  description: 'I doubt that this is an actual cover for an actual NASA report. But I like how it feels dramatic
, almost like a poster for a sci-fi horror film. The piece also features "The Worm", the simplified logo NASA commissioned under the Nixon administration. Shame both that logo and the SETI programme got abandoned in the 90s.'
