SCface - Surveillance Cameras Face Database,2011,"SCface is a database of static images of human faces. Images were taken in uncontrolled indoor environment using five video surveillance cameras of various qualities. Database contains 4160 static images (in visible and infrared spectrum) of 130 subjects. Images from different quality cameras mimic the real-world conditions and enable robust face recognition algorithms testing, emphasizing different law enforcement and surveillance use case scenarios."," Mislav Grgic, Kresimir Delac","Capturing face images took place in Video Communications Laboratory at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb, Croatia. Capture equipment included: six surveillance cameras, professional digital video surveillance recorder, professional high-quality photo camera and a computer. For mug shot image acquisition we used a high-quality photo camera. For surveillance camera image acquisition we used five different (commercially available) models of surveillance cameras and for IR mug shots a separate surveillance camera was used.",http://www.scface.org/,130,4160,http://www.scface.org/SCface%20-%20Surveillance%20Cameras%20Face%20Database.pdf,
ATT Database of Faces,1994,"There are ten different images of each of 40 distinct subjects. For some subjects, the images were taken at different times, varying the lighting, facial expressions (open / closed eyes, smiling / not smiling) and facial details (glasses / no glasses). All the images were taken against a dark homogeneous background with the subjects in an upright, frontal position (with tolerance for some side movement).",AT&T Laboratories Cambridge.,"Images taken by researchers at Cambridge university, of people in the department",https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/attarchive/facedatabase.html,40,400,https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/attarchive/abstracts.html#55,

Facebook Face Database (Also referred to as Social  Face  Classification  (SFC)),2014,"TheSFCdatasetincludes 4.4 million labeled faces from4,030 people each with 800 to 1200 faces, where the mostrecent 5% of face images of each identity are left out fortesting.  This is done according to the imagesâ€™ time-stampin order to simulate continuous identification through aging.The large number of images per person provides a uniqueopportunity for learning the invariance needed for the coreproblem of face recognition.  We have validated using sev-eral  automatic  methods,  that  the  identities  used  for  train-ing do not intersect with any of the identities in the below-mentioned datasets, by checking their name labels",,Facebook Users,https://research.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/deepface-closing-the-gap-to-human-level-performance-in-face-verification.pdf,"4,000","4,400,000",,
